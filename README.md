 The Rice on the Chessboard problem
-----------------------------------
    
    Many centuries ago, a mathematician invented a game we now know as Chess.
    The King realised how amazing this game was, and wanted to reward the inventor.
    He offered the inventor a choice: a huge pile of gold, equivalent to a $1M in
    today's money, or the following.
      1 grain of rice on the first square of the chessboard
      2 grains on the second square
      4 grains on the third square
      etc.

    The inventor chose the rice. After all, you can eat Rice, but you can't eat Gold.

    Your task is to write a program that prints how many grains of rice there are on
    each square, and print the total amount of rice on the chessboard.
 
    If/when the numbers become very large, you should switch to a larger unit when 
    printing the number. Use the following: 
       * 1kg = 50,000 grains
       * 1 ton = 1000 kg  (*)
       * Titanic = 52000 tons
       * The Empire State Building weights 365000 tons
       * Hoover Dam: 6.6 million tons
       * 1 cubic km == 1,000,000,000 tons
       * Total Coal reserves in China (2009) = 1.73bn Tons
    (*) these numbers are accurate enough for the purpose of
    this exercise, even if they might be a bit off in real life

    Please send me the output, and you can send me the code too, if you like.
    The problem, and the maths are discussed here too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem
    (it's a programming exercise, not a maths puzzle; the maths answers are on the wiki page)

    (should cover loops, variables, basic mathematical operations and conditions)
